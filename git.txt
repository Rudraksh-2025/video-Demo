What Is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your files or codebase. It allows you to:

1.Keep a history of changes.
2.Collaborate with others, merging each otherâ€™s work seamlessly (with branches and merges).
3.Revert or compare old versions of your project.

step 1:git init
step 2:git status
step 3:git add .
step 4:git commit -m "Initial commit"
step 5:git log
step 6:git push

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

git push -u origin main

git checkout -b new-feature
# Switch back to main
git checkout main
# Merge new-feature into main
git merge new-feature
#delete branch
git branch -d new-feature
git pull origin main


git log --oneline
# Copy the commit hash you want to revert

# 2. Revert that commit
git revert <commit-hash>
