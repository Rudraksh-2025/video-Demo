Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your files or codebase. It allows you to:

1.Keep a history of changes.
2.Collaborate with others, merging each otherâ€™s work seamlessly (with branches and merges).
3.Revert or compare old versions of your project.

Basic git terminology

1. Repository(Repo):A folder or project tracked by git
2. Commit: A SnapShot of your project changes.
3. Staging Area: A place where you put your code before Commit.
4. Branch: A seperate timeline of commits.

Step 1. git init
Step 2. git status
Step 3. git add . # Add all files in the project
Step 4. git commit -m "Initial commit"
Step 5. git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
Step 6. git push -u origin main

Branches allow you to experiment or develop new features without affecting the main code.
